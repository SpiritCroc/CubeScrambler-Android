# CubeScrambler

A simple Android app built around [tnoodle-lib](https://github.com/thewca/tnoodle-lib),
in order to quickly generate scramble instructions and previews for a selection of cubing puzzles
(currently only Rubik's cubes 2x2 - 7x7 included, but others supported by the lib are likely easy to add).
