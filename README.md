# CubeScrambler

A simple Android app built around [tnoodle-lib](https://github.com/thewca/tnoodle-lib),
in order to quickly generate scramble instructions and previews for a selection of cubing puzzles (currently buttons for Rubik's cubes 2x2 - 7x7 included).

## TODO

- [ ] Icon
- [ ] Layout paddings and better arrangement of scramble buttons (FlexBox layout?)
- [ ] Better canvas sizing for drawing scrambles
- [ ] Add other puzzles supported by the lib
